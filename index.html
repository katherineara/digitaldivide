            <div class="col-sm">
              Through the use of the Javascript Library D3.js, HTML, and CSS, this project visualizes data about access to the 
              internet and computers in order to illustrate the Digital Divide in the United States and California. The Digital Divide 
              is defined as the unequal access of technology to different groups based on social, demographic, or geographic factors. 
              Due to the global pandemic, technology has become an essential part of work, communication, education, and more. Even though 
              technology seems ubiquitous in the 21st century, many people still lack the tools to succeed in this increasingly digital 
              environment. With new social distancing recommendations, most schools have had to transition to online learning and many 
              offices have closed for employees. Students and families are more reliant on technology now than ever before, yet this 
              privilege is not afforded to everyone equally. Even in California, where there is a focus on technology and innovation in 
              the Silicon Valley, not everyone has access to these basic resources. Black, Latino, rural, and low-income households in 
              California have been disproportionately affected, which further deepens the divide between these communities. This project 
              utilizes census and survey data to create an interactive visualization that illustrates the disparities in access to 
              technology and ways to close the gap.

          This project further explores the work started by Amanda Lee on
          Visualizing the Digital Divide in New York. Instead of New York, this project will focus on the United States and Calfornia
          after the impact of the pandemic. To create this project I used D3 which is a Javascript library for data visualization. I used 
          the skills I learned from the course Data and Information Visualization with Professor Rushmeier and Professor Brown. 
          I hosted the HTML, CSS, and JS code on a Heroku-Server and I used VS-Code with Airbnb Style Formatting.

            In the first graph, I use bar graphs to portray the percent of students in households with no internet or computer access 
            by income from 2016 and 2020. In the second graph, I use bar graphs to illustrate the same percentage based on race. The 
            data was collected from USA Facts and the Census Data from the American Community Survey.

            <b>Design Choices</b><br>
            Since we have the categorical variables of income and race on the x axis and the quantitative variable of percentage on the 
            y axis, I decided to use bar graphs to represent the data in a clear and concise format. By using double bar charts grouped 
            together, the differences between computer and internet data can be compared more easily. I also allow the user to interact 
            with the data by having an option to view the results in alphabetical, ascending, or descending order. Hovering over the graph 
            allows the user to see the percentages. Clicking on the button transforms the bar charts using a smooth transition. This can 
            help the user to easily see which groups are the most and the least affected by the digital divide.

            <b>Takeaways</b><br>
            From analyzing the first graph, it is clear that lower-income households have a major disadvantage in getting access to 
            computers and the internet. The percentage of people who lack internet or computer access consistently declines with more 
            wealth. The graph also shows that on average, there are more people who have access to the internet than computers. Some people 
            might have internet connection in their homes in order to use their other devices like smartphones, but computers are very 
            expensive which might explain why some people have more difficulty accessing them than others.

            <br><br>

            The second graph shows that groups of people who are American Indian, Black, and Hispanic have a harder time on average 
            getting access to the computer and internet. However, people from an caucasian or asian have a lower percentage of people 
            who lack access to these basic needs. It is interesting to compare the data from 2016 and 2020 to see if there have been any 
            improvements in the Digital Divide. There have been many initiatives and programs to close the gap over the last few years, 
            however after looking at the data, it appears that the same inequalities are still present.

            In the second graph, I use data from the Household Pulse Survey to look at the percentage of people that have access 
            to a device available for educational purposes. I plotted various different categories based on age, gender, education, 
            race, marital status, children, employment status, food sufficiency, and household income. 
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row">
            <b>Design Choices</b><br>
            I used a line chart because I wanted to show the trends over time starting from April to November 2020. The Household 
            Pulse Survey from the US Census Bureau was a new program that was designed to collect information about the impact of 
            the global pandemic on peopleâ€™s lives in the United States. The user can click on the different categories to see the 
            results from that data presented on a line chart and the trend over time in 2020. By clicking on the different categories, 
            the user can look at how this data changes based on the different social and demographic factors. The colors differentiate 
            the lines and are labeled in the legend to provide more insight into the trends. By hovering over the data points, the user 
            can see the percentages I calculated using the raw data. I took the 9 different months from 2020 and went through each 
            spreadsheet, calculating the percentages for each category and adding it to a csv file. It was a time-consuming process to 
            clean, aggregate, and calculate the data from multiple sources, but it was very informative once the dataset was finally 
            visualized.

            <b>Takeaways</b><br>
            These line graphs provide important insights into which groups have more or less access to computer devices for 
            education based on multiple factors. For these graphs, a higher data point is better because that means a larger 
            percentage of people have access. The age graph illustrates that people who are older have more access compared to a 
            younger demographic. Even though children and youth are the ones who need devices for educational purposes the most, 
            not all of them have it for connecting to their online courses.In the gender graph, there is also a slight gap between 
            male and female ownership of devices, which reflects the gender gap in many areas of life. In the educational graph, those 
            who have a higher educational degree like college and bachelor degree have more access to technology than students in 
            elementary or high schools. The graphs by household income and race emphasize the same findings from the previous 
            visualizations. The food sufficiency graph reveals that some households who donâ€™t have enough food at home may also have a 
            lack of connectivity to the online world. In some of the graphs there appears to be a dip in the percentages around the 
            months of June and July. There could be multiple reasons for the drop in technological access like unemployment, but that 
            cannot be inferred from this dataset. But overall there appears to be an upward trend on most of the graphs, which hopefully 
            means that the divide is improving and more people are finding resources to access the internet and computers.

            This is a choropleth map that divides up California into different counties to see how geographic location and other 
            factors can have an impact on technology access. The centroids in each county are shown by the circles. The saturation 
            of the colors show the broadband subscription rate in each county with the darker color indicating a higher percentage. 
            The size of the circles correlates to the median household income. Hovering over the county also shows the covid cases in 
            that county per 1M people on a bar graph.

            I used a json of the California counties and the geoAlbersUSA projection to plot the path points onto the map. Then I used 
            data from the California Gov Open Data Portal to get more information about the average household income and then combined 
            that with census data about the percentage of broadband subscribers in each county. I decided to use a choropleth map because 
            I wanted to see if there were any geographic areas that had less access to the internet and if  location has an impact on 
            technology accessibility. I also wanted to compare the broadband subscription rate to the covid cases to see if there was 
            any correlation between them.

            <b>Takeaways</b><br>
            It appears that the less dense and rural areas have a lighter blue color on the map which indicates that they have a 
            lower percentage of households with broadband subscriptions. The cities like the San Francisco Bay Area also have both 
            the largest centroid circles and darkest blue color which indicates that they have a higher median household income and 
            more broadband subscriptions. There is such a large focus on supplying resources to large cities, but that often leaves 
            others behind who also need it. There doesnâ€™t appear to be a direct correlation between coronavirus cases and access to 
            broadband services, because there are many other factors that might affect this statistic more directly.

            In the final map, I wanted to show how cities are taking initiatives to bridge the digital divide and to see if they 
            were heading in the right direction. Since we know that the internet is needed in areas with low income, I used a choropleth 
            map of the City of San Francisco divided up into its different neighborhoods. SFGov has set up multiple free Wifi hotspots 
            in the City in an effort to give people more access if they need it. These parks and recreation centers are plotted on the map.

            json of San Francisco and the geoAlbersUSA projection to build the paths and map them with D3. Then I combined that information 
            with household income data and unemployment data from the American Community Survey census study that analyzed each neighborhood 
            in SF. The darker blue color correlates with the average household income in that neighborhood. I researched the various places 
            that SF was offering free Wifi hotspots and I calculated their latitude and longitude points to place them on the map. I added 
            interaction so that they could hover over places on the map and see the names of the location.

            <b>Takeaways</b><br>
            With the Silicon Valley located in California, the West Coast is known for being a hub for technology and innovation. 
            Especially in San Francisco, there are many initiatives to focus on Computer Science education and give people the tools 
            and skills to access technology and increase digital literacy. However, there are still disparities between different 
            groups within the community and a need for more laptops and digital devices at home now that it is more difficult to share 
            between families when everyone needs access to strong internet. When schools across the state went online in Spring 2020, 
            thousands of laptops and hotspots were needed for students to continue their education. It looks like the City is giving 
            people Wifi Hotspots but they can still do more to spread their reach to the different neighborhoods and other parts of 
            the city that need it. By setting up more resources to reach people in groups that have less access to the internet and 
            computers, the government and organizations can help bridge the Digital Divide.

        <div class="col-sm">
          The global pandemic has brought to light many racial and socioeconomic disparities that have divided our country even further 
          apart. Many people who might have basic necessities like food and shelter donâ€™t have access to the internet or tech devices, 
          which are becoming an increasingly essential part of living in the digital age. Without the internet, it becomes challenging 
          to work, learn, grow, and connect with others in a safe way that doesnâ€™t put lives at risk for the virus. This project allowed
          me to visualize the digital divide and illustrate that there are still many more steps, initiatives, and programs that can be put 
          in place to support those who need access to technology, so we can move forward and keep innovating, creating, and 
          learning - without leaving anyone behind.
